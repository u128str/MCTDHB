This folder contains a 2D example of the LR-MCTDHB code
using the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method (IRAM).

System: 2D harmonic interaction model (HIM)
        N=100, M=3

Instructions to run the example:

1) Use the MCTDHB imaginary time propagation to get the ground state on
   which linear-response is applied afterwards:

   mpirun -n 3 ./boson_MCTDHB_gnu_MKLFFT

2) Construct the LR-matrix. Input parameters are located in "lr_arnoldi.in".
   Important: task = 1 => construction mode of the LR-ARNOLDI code.
   There are given short explanations of all other parameters.
   NOTE: For the HIM model it is important to set tol1=1e-11
   or even lower to get accurate results.

   mpirun -n 16 ./lr_arnoldi_gnu_MKLFFT

3) Partial diagonalization of the LR-matrix. Set "task = 2" in 
   "lr_arnoldi.in". Output files are written in folder "Eigenv" and subfolders.

   mpirun -n 16 ./lr_arnoldi_gnu_MKLFFT

4) Compare the values in "Eigenv/eigenvalues.dat" with the values in    
   "Ref_eigenvalues_M1.dat".
